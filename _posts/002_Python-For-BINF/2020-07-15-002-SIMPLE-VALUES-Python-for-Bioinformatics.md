 <!-- how you doing guys bioinformatics guyhere with another video of the seriespython for bioinformaticsin this video we will be talking aboutthe simple values the simple valuesincludebooleans integers floats special valuesand the most important values stringsso let's get started so let's start byopening ouridl e the first value is the booleanvalue which is also known as logicalvalues i know in one of your exams youhave attempted this question in whichyou have to write true or falsethis is the same thing so t r ue true or f a l s e falsethese are the two values true or falseyou can check the type of this value byusing this function t by p e typeand then enter true and this is a casesensitive value if you will enter wrongspellings just like hereyou will get an error if you will keepthis first tsmall you will also get in here t r u eyou will also get an error so we willtalk about the use of this value in thefuture videosso the next value is integers integersare just like numbers 1 23 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 so on and so forththese also include negative numbers so 123 this is a number 1 is a number 2 is anumberand you can check the type of this bythe same functiontype and enter an integer over hereso here are some examples -1[Music]you can also enter a really huge numberslike thisand you can notice that separators suchas commas or periods are not used inpythonyou will just get a plain number and weare going to use these numbers in latervideosso the next type is float float is theabbreviated version of the term flooringpointso float is basically equivalent ofscientific notation and you might bealready familiar with such numberthese are known as floats because thesecontain a digit and an exponentexponent is adjusted so that the decimalpoint floats just after the first digitso here are someexamples 2.5 0.0001and this is a very huge floatand as you can see that when you willenter a really huge floatit is represented in this e formright over here and you can check itstype by using the same functiontype and enter a float over here 1.2and its float the next is special valueit is special because it is no value itis basically used when you have missingvalues in the dataand it is represented by n o n e nonesee even if you enter over here you getnothing so let's talk about strings wewill be using this type a lot in thisseriescan you make a grasp why strings are soimportant in the seriesplease pause the video and make guess inthe comments down belowso this type of simple value is used toenter text in pythonso it has to be enclosed in singlequotesor double quotes we enter it in triplequotes for multiple linesso here is our first example of thestringpython 4 bioinformaticsso let me tell you the reason why wewill be using strings a lot in ourseries the reason is that we will beworking with the dnarna based sequences and amino acidsequenceswhich are in the form of text and wewill be needing help from the strings toenter those in python so let us takesome example of entering amino acidsequences in python it's likem and k m dl m and k[Music]so we have entered a protein sequencelet's try entering a dna sequence a tg c t c t c d c g a cg a c d a tso we have entered a dna sequence if youhave to enter a multiple line sequenceyou can enter it in triple quotes in thenext video we will be talking aboutexpressions whichinclude numerical operators logicaloperations and a very important stringoperation so if you have any questionsor concerns about this videodon't hesitate to comment down below youcan always find me there for helpif you want to find out what i do otherthan programming please check out myvlogging channelthank you very much for watching and iwill see you around in the next video[Music]  -->
