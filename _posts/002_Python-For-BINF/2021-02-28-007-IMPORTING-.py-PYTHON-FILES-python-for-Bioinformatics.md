Hey bioinformatics enthusiasts! 

Welcome back to another post in the Python for Bioinformatics series. In todayâ€™s discussion, weâ€™ll learn how to import Python functions from custom .py files. This approach is super useful for structuring your bioinformatics projects efficiently by reusing code.

If youâ€™ve watched our previous video on importing modules from Python libraries, you already know how convenient it is to use prebuilt functions. But what if you need to create and import your own? Thatâ€™s exactly what weâ€™ll cover today.

# Step 1: Creating a Python File
First, we need a Python file that contains our reusable functions. Letâ€™s create a file called `functions.py` and populate it with some functions weâ€™ve used previously.

Hereâ€™s the code for `functions.py`:

```python
import random

def random_base(RNAFlag=False):
    """Return a random base. Use 'U' instead of 'T' if RNAFlag is True."""
    return ("UCGA" if RNAFlag else "TCGA")[random.randint(0, 3)]

def random_codon(RNAFlag=False):
    """Return a random codon (three random bases)."""
    return random_base(RNAFlag) + random_base(RNAFlag) + random_base(RNAFlag)

def replace_base_randomly_using_names(base_seq):
    """
    Replace a random base in the sequence with another randomly chosen base.
    """
    position = random.randint(0, len(base_seq) - 1)
    bases = "TCGA"
    bases = bases.replace(base_seq[position], "")
    new_base = bases[random.randint(0, 2)]
    return base_seq[:position] + new_base + base_seq[position + 1:]

```

Save this file in a specific folder, such as your Desktop.

# Step 2: Importing Functions
Now that we have functions.py, letâ€™s create another Python file to test our imports. Save this file in the same folder as functions.py. For this example, weâ€™ll name it testing.py.

Hereâ€™s the code for testing.py:
```python
from functions import random_base, random_codon, replace_base_randomly_using_names

# Testing `random_base`
print(random_base(True))  # Example: 'U'

# Testing `random_codon`
print(random_codon(True))  # Example: 'UCC'

# Testing `replace_base_randomly_using_names`
print(replace_base_randomly_using_names("ATGCTA"))  # Example: 'ATGCCA'

```

# Step 3: Running the Code
When running testing.py, ensure that itâ€™s in the same folder as functions.py. If everything is set up correctly, youâ€™ll see output similar to the following:
```python
U
UCC
ATGCCA

```

# Common Errors and Fixes
- `ModuleNotFoundError`: This occurs when Python cannot find the file youâ€™re trying to import. Make sure both files are in the same folder or add the path to `sys.path`.

Spelling Errors: Double-check function names during import. For instance, importing `random_base` as `random` will cause errors.

# Why This Matters in Bioinformatics
Organizing your code into separate files promotes modularity and reusability. Instead of duplicating code, you can focus on analyzing genetic sequences, building pipelines, or processing biological datasets more efficiently.

<!-- hi guys bioinformatics guy here with another video of the series python for bioinformatics in this video we will be talking about importing python files dot p-vals files just like in the previous video that we could we imported a few files and modules from other libraries that were already created in python we can import our own functions from our own files so let's get started first of all we will have to create a python file and let's create a python file in let's open idle this time i am working in viral because most of you guys will also be working in other so i just want to you to see the same experience so this is our file and let's copy some functions um from our previous file so we will have to import random then we can copy this function random base then we can copy another function random codon okay after that let's copy this function yes that's pretty much it okay now let's save this file on desktop um here is our desktop and i'm gonna name this file as functions functions dot py okay it's saved so i have created this file in which we have these three functions random base oh let me correct the spellings of random here random base random codon and replace base randomly using names okay i will just save this file now i will create a new python file over here and we can import the functions so let's try simply importing random base from functions import random base okay let's try running this the one more thing that you need to understand is that you will have to save this file in the very same folder in which there you have the functions file or from which you are trying to import any functions so let me name it as testing and this function is imported nicely let's try running this function um random base um and we will have to print it to see the results okay this is the cell so you can see that a base is imported right and let's try importing some other thing uh random codon from functions import random codon and let's try printing the c-o-d-o-n random base is not defined uh now it's giving me an error random base is not defined oh random so i change the spellings over here and the spellings are also supposed to be chained here it is supposed to be random rather than random random base then we have a random base over here let's try running this and let's try running this and see in the shell so random base is also printed and if you want to try printing the third function which is this let's try importing this and let's try if this function gets imported or not from functions import this huge function with huge name and let's print this and let's give it okay let's see if some codon is changed or not unexpected oh missing parentheses and let's remove this one again let's go to the shell so it has imported first a random base then it imported a random codon then it made this change in this g-sync g change this t to g let's try running this again and now c is changed so that's all for today if you have any questions comments or concerns about this video feel free to comment down below if you want to join our bioinformatics community don't forget to join the facebook group bioinformatics guys you can find the description down below if you want to know what i do other than programming don't forget to check out my vlogging channel right here other than that thank you very much for watching and i will see you around in the next video  -->
