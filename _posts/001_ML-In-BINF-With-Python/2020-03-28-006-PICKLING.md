Welcome to another video of the series [__Machine Learning in Bioinformatics With Python__](/001-Machine-Learning-in-Bioinformatics-With-Python). In the last video we trained the models and then checked the accuracy of the those models. Before moving on to making the protections from those models. I would like to share a very important thing and that is saving and loading those trained models.

For the sake of this example we have trained on a very small data so whenever we train our models it only takes a few seconds but when you
will start to train your models on huge data. It is going to take a lot of time so after training a model it is always a good idea to save that model in a form of a file.


Let's get started, in order to save the model we will be using a library and its name is `pickle`. Just like pickling (preserving vagetables) in real life we will be preserving our models in the world of programming. 

First of we will have to import the library like this:

{% highlight python %}
import pickle
{% endhighlight %}

So saving the model is very easy we will use `pickle.dump()` with two arguments. The first argument is the name of the model and the second argument is another function `open()`. Open function takes two arguments, the first one is the name of the file with extension and the second argument is the mode. See the different types of modes in the following table:


|Symbol   | Format                    |Position   |  File Handeling                                       | 
|------   | -----------               | --------  |  -------                                              |
|**r**    | Read Only                 | Beginning |  Raises I/O error                                     |
|**rb**   | Read Only in Binary       | Beginning |  Raises I/O error                                     |
|**r+**   | Read and Write            | Beginning |  Raises I/O error                                     |
|**w**    | Write only                | Beginning |  Creates the file otherwise over-writes the data      |
|**wb**   | Write only in Binary      | Beginning |  Creates the file otherwise over-writes the data      |
|**w+**   | Read and Write            | Beginning |  Creates the file otherwise over-writes the data      |
|**wb+**  | Read and Write in Binary  | Beginning |  Creates the file otherwise over-writes the data      |
|**a**    | Append only               | End       |  Creates the file otherwise over-writes the data      |
|**ab**   | Append only in Binary     | End       |  Creates the file otherwise over-writes the data      |
|**a+**   | Append and read           | End       |  Creates the file otherwise over-writes the data      |
|**ab+**  | Append and read in Binary | End       |  Creates the file otherwise over-writes the data      |

You dont need to worry about remembering all the details in the table above this is just for future reference.

Since logistic regression is giving us the highest accuracy we will save that model which can be done by the following code:

{% highlight python %}
pickle.dump(model, open("LogisticRegression.m", "wb"))
{% endhighlight %}

Loading the saved model is also very easy. We will have to use `pickle.load()` function with `open()` function as an argument. The open function contains two argument the name of the file and the mode and here is the code. Woah it rhymes :P

{% highlight python %}
loaded_model = pickle.load(open("LogisticRegression.m", "rb")
{% endhighlight %}

Then you can simply print the accuracy using the loaded model:

{% highlight python %}
accu = loaded_model.score(X_test, y_test)
print("Accuracy of Logistic Regression : ", accu)
{% endhighlight %}


That's all for now and next we will be **finally** making our predictions.
