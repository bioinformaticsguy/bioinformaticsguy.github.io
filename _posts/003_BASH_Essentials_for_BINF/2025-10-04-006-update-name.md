In this lesson we will learn how to copy the files, move them around, and rename them. We we will also learn how to use standard output to write to files.

## Why File Management Matters

In bioinformatics, you'll work with hundreds or thousands of files‚Äîraw data, analysis results, scripts, and references. Knowing how to efficiently copy, move, and organize files is essential for:
- Creating organized project structures
- Making data backups before processing
- Reorganizing analysis outputs
- Cleaning up intermediate files to save space

Let's explore the core commands that make this possible.

---

## Copying Files: The `cp` Command

### Basic File Copying

The `cp` (copy) command creates a duplicate of a file. The basic syntax is:

```bash
cp <original_filename> <new_filename>
```

**Example: Copying in the same directory**

```bash
cp tiny_n_L001_R1_xxx.fastq.gz tiny_n_L001_R1_xxx.fastq.gz.copy 
ls
```

This creates a duplicate with a new name. Both files now exist independently‚Äîchanges to one won't affect the other.

### Copying to Different Directories

You can copy files to other locations while keeping or changing the filename:

```bash
# Create a new directory for copies
mkdir fastq_copies

# Copy with the same filename
cp yeast_01_R2.fastq.gz fastq_copies/copy-yeast_02_R2.fastq.gz

# Copy with a new filename
cp yeast_02_R2.fastq.gz fastq_copies/

# Verify the copies
ls fastq_copies/
```

You have noticed that even if you do not mention the name of the orignal name of the file is used and is placed in the new directory.


**What happened here?**
- `yeast_02_R2.fastq.gz` was copied and renamed to `copy-yeast_02_R2.fastq.gz`
- `yeast_01_R2.fastq.gz` was copied to `fastq_copies/` with the same name

### When to Use `cp`

- **Creating backups** before running destructive analyses
- **Duplicating reference files** for different projects
- **Testing workflows** on copies before processing originals
- **Preserving originals** while experimenting with modifications

---

## Moving and Renaming: The `mv` Command

### The Dual Purpose of `mv`

Unlike `cp`, the `mv` (move) command **doesn't create a copy**‚Äîit relocates or renames the file. The original disappears from its previous location.

**Syntax:**
```bash
mv <original_filename> <new_filename_or_location>
```

### Moving Files Between Directories

```bash
mv ctiny_n_L001_R1_xxx.fastq.gz.copy fastq_copies/
cd fastq_copies
ls
```

The file is now **only** in `fastq_copies/`‚Äîit no longer exists in the original directory.

### Renaming Files

```bash
mv yeast_01_R2.fastq.gz copy-yeast_01_R2.fastq.gz
ls
```

When both arguments are in the same directory, `mv` renames the file instead of moving it.

### When to Use `mv`

- **Reorganizing project structures** after initial data exploration
- **Renaming files** to follow consistent naming conventions
- **Moving processed data** to results directories
- **Cleaning up workflows** by relocating intermediate files

**‚ö†Ô∏è Caution:** `mv` is destructive‚Äîthe original location/name is gone. Double-check your commands!

---

## Removing Files: The `rm` Command

### Deleting Individual Files

The `rm` (remove) command permanently deletes files. **There is no recycle bin or undo!**

```bash
rm copy-yeast_01_R2.fastq.gz
```

**üí° Safety tip:** Always double-check filenames before pressing Enter. Consider using `ls` first to verify the file exists.

### Removing Directories

To delete a directory and **all its contents**, use the `-r` (recursive) flag:

```bash
cd ..
rm -r fastq_copies/
```

The `-r` flag tells `rm` to:
1. Enter the directory
2. Delete all files inside
3. Delete all subdirectories and their contents
4. Delete the directory itself

### Removing Empty Directories

For empty directories, you have two options:

```bash
rm -r empty_directory/
# OR
rmdir empty_directory/
```

The `rmdir` command only works on empty directories‚Äîit's a safer option when you want to ensure nothing important gets deleted.

### Critical Safety Warning

üö® **The `rm` command is permanent!** 
- Deleted files **cannot be recovered**
- No confirmation prompt by default
- Especially dangerous with `-r` flag and wildcards

**Best practices:**
- Use `ls` to preview files before `rm`
- Consider `rm -i` for interactive confirmation (asks before each deletion)
- Never use `rm -rf` carelessly (especially not as root user!)
- Keep backups of important data

## Understanding Standard Output

### The `echo` Command

`echo` prints text to the screen (standard output or "stdout"):

```bash
echo 'Hello, World.'
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, World.
```

### Quotes: When Are They Needed?

Let's experiment:

```bash
echo 'hello'
echo hello
```

Both produce:
```
hello
```

So far, quotes seem optional. But watch what happens with special characters:

```bash
echo hello!!
```

**Output:**
```
echo helloecho hello!
helloecho hello!
```

**What went wrong?** The `!!` has special meaning in bash (history expansion). Now with quotes:

```bash
echo 'hello!!'
```

**Output:**
```
hello!!
```

**When to use quotes:**
- Text contains special characters: `! $ * ? [ ] ( ) { } ; | & < >`
- Text has spaces: `echo 'Hello, World!'`
- You want exact literal text
- **Best practice:** Use quotes by default to avoid surprises

## Output Redirection: Writing Files

### The `>` Operator (Overwrite)

Instead of printing to the screen, we can redirect output to a file using `>`:

```bash
echo hello > hello.txt
```

This creates `hello.txt` with the content "hello". If `hello.txt` already exists, **it will be overwritten**!

```bash
echo hello > hello.txt
echo hello > hello.txt  # Still just one "hello"
cat hello.txt
```

**Output:**
```
hello
```

Each `>` overwrites the previous content.

### The `>>` Operator (Append)

To add content to the end of a file without overwriting, use `>>`:

```bash
echo hello >> hellohello.txt
echo hello >> hellohello.txt
cat hellohello.txt
```

**Output:**
```
hello
hello
```

Each `>>` adds a new line to the file.

### Practical Applications

**Creating sample files:**
```bash
echo ">sequence1" > sample.fasta
echo "ATCGATCGATCG" >> sample.fasta
echo ">sequence2" >> sample.fasta
echo "GCTAGCTAGCTA" >> sample.fasta
```

**Logging analysis results:**
```bash
echo "Analysis started: $(date)" > analysis_log.txt
echo "Processing sample1..." >> analysis_log.txt
echo "Completed successfully" >> analysis_log.txt
```

**Creating metadata files:**
```bash
echo "sample_id\tcondition\treplicate" > metadata.tsv
echo "sample1\tcontrol\t1" >> metadata.tsv
echo "sample2\ttreated\t1" >> metadata.tsv
```

## Quick Reference Table

| Command | Purpose | Example | Caution |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| `cp` | Copy files | `cp data.txt backup.txt` | Creates duplicate |
| `mv` | Move/rename | `mv old.txt new.txt` | Original removed |
| `rm` | Delete files | `rm temp.txt` | **Permanent!** |
| `rm -r` | Delete directories | `rm -r temp_folder/` | **Very dangerous!** |
| `>` | Write/overwrite | `echo "text" > file.txt` | Overwrites existing |
| `>>` | Append | `echo "text" >> file.txt` | Adds to end |

## Practice Exercise

Try these commands to reinforce your learning:

1. Create a directory called `practice`
2. Copy a FASTQ file into it with a new name
3. Create a text file using `echo >` with your name
4. Append your favorite organism to that file using `>>`
5. Rename the text file using `mv`
6. Move the FASTQ file back to the parent directory
7. Remove the `practice` directory

**Solution:**
```bash
mkdir practice
cp yeast_01_R1.fastq.gz practice/practice_file.fastq.gz
echo "Your Name" > practice/info.txt
echo "Favorite organism: Yeast" >> practice/info.txt
cd practice
mv info.txt myinfo.txt
mv practice_file.fastq.gz ../
cd ..
rm -r practice/
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Using `rm -r` without double-checking**
```bash
rm -r important_data/  # Oops, meant to delete temp_data/
```

‚ùå **Overwriting important files with `>`**
```bash
echo "test" > critical_results.txt  # Just erased everything!
```

‚ùå **Forgetting `-r` when removing directories**
```bash
rm data_folder/  # Error: cannot remove directory
```

‚úÖ **Safe practices:**
```bash
ls data_folder/      # Check contents first
rm -r data_folder/   # Then remove
```
