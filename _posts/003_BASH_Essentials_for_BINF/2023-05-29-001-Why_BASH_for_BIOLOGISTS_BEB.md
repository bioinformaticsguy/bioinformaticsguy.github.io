In this series, we'll be exploring the power of Bash commands and most importantly why learning Bash is crucial for Biologists to enter in the realm of Bioinformatics?


# What is Bash?

If you've seen any movies about hacking, you're probably familiar with black scenes with green text. The hacker sits at the computer, fingers flying across the keyboard, as lines of code and text scroll rapidly across the screen. 

<p style="text-align: center;" style="color:red;"> But what exactly is the hacker doing? What is this mysterious text-based interface that they're using?</p>


This interface is known as a Command Line Interface, or CLI for short. It's a way of interacting with a computer using text commands, rather than a graphical user interface (GUI) like you might be used to. One of the most common types of CLI is Bash.

# Why BASH for Biologists?

Well there are so many reasons but I will give you 2 most important reasons. 

1. As biologists, we work with a lot of data - whether it's genetic sequences, protein structures, or experimental results. And while there are some software tools available to help us analyse this data, however if you want to use the latest and greatest cutting edge open source Bioinformatics tools then learning the basics of BASH can come in handy because most of the latest Bioinformatics tools dont come with Graphical User Interface. 
2. When we are working with big data you have to use supercomputers and it is rather difficult to buy and maintain a supercomputer in your home. So, those super computers are present in specific locations where they can be kept cool and maintained they way they are supposed to be maintained. The good thing is that you can access those supercomputers and run your Bioinformatics Pipelines from the comfort of your laptop just by using BASH. Those supercomputers are generally known as HPC’s.

# What and why is HPC?

You might have heard this term HPC. These are known as high-performance computing (HPC) clusters. These clusters are essential for processing large-scale bioinformatics datasets, but they require a solid understanding of Bash commands to navigate and interact with the system because usually they don’t come with a GUI so you have to do all the things by using bash commands. From opening a folder to copying files and running scripts.

# Things you can do with BASH

With Bash, you can automate common tasks, manipulate and filter data, and even create your own custom scripts to streamline your workflow. Whether you're just getting started in bioinformatics or you're an experienced researcher, understanding Bash commands is a valuable skill that can take your data analysis to the next level.

<!-- # How to get started?

It depends on what kind of machine you will be using. Some machines will offer you full functionalilty and some machines will offer you limited functionality. In some machines it will be very easy to open the terminal and some machines you will have to do some effort to get started. 

## Mac
Almost always you will be working with either from your Mac, Windows or a machine in which Linux is already running. Let's start with what you will have to do if you wanna work on mac. It is the most simple of all actually.

| To open the Terminal on a Mac, you can follow these steps below!

1. Click on the Launchpad icon in the Dock (or alternatively, click on the Spotlight icon in the menu bar, or press Command + Spacebar) to bring up the search field.

2. Type "Terminal" in the search field.

3. Click on the Terminal app when it appears in the search results.

| Alternatively, you can also open Terminal using the Finder

1. Open a Finder window.

2. Click on "Applications" in the sidebar.

3. Scroll down and open the "Utilities" folder.

4. Double-click on the "Terminal" app to launch it.

5. Once the Terminal app is open, you can start typing commands and using the command-line interface.

Once you have successfully openend the terminal you should see something like below:

> Information about running terminal on Windows and Linux machine will be added soon! -->


Next, we'll learn how you can access bach ot terminal on your machine, be it mac, linux or windows. All different operating systems will be covered. Thanks for your time and will see you next time ;)
