# Lesson 03. Reading, Writing, Moving, Copying, Removing, Gunzipping 

## cp
We use the `cp` command to make a copy files. If you want to copy a file into the same directory then used something like `cp <oringinal_filename.txt> <new_filename>`. For example:

~~~ {.bash}
$ cp yeast_01_R1.fastq.gz  copy_yeast_01_R1.fastq.gz
$ ls
~~~

You can also make a copy of the file but store it in a new location. Here's are two examples. One will keep the file name the same but the other command will change the name. We can use less to see that the copied files are in the new directory

~~~ {.bash}
$ mkdir fastq_copies
$ cp yeast_01_R2.fastq.gz fastq_copies/
$ cp yeast_02_R2.fastq.gz  fastq_copies/copy-yeast_02_R2.fastq.gz
$ ls fastq_copies/
~~~

## mv
If we don't want to keep an original copy, we use the `mv` command **to move** or **to rename** files. We use the syntax `mv <origingalfilename> <newfilename>

~~~ {.bash}
$ mv copy_yeast_01_R1.fastq.gz fastq_copies/
$ cd fastq_copies
$ ls	
$ mv yeast_01_R2.fastq.gz copy-yeast_01_R2.fastq.gz
$ ls
~~~

## rm 
We can use the `rm` command to remove files. 

~~~ {.bash}
$ rm copy-yeast_01_R2.fastq.gz
~~~

To remove a non-empty directory we must add the flag ` -r`. The `-r `means recursive or, in this case, remove the directory and everything inside it.

~~~ {.bash}
$ cd ..
$ rm -r fastq_copies/
~~~

If you want to remove an empty directory, you can use `rm -r` or `rmdir`.


## Standard Output


`echo` is a command we can use to print something to the screen, like "Hello, World." 

~~~ {.bash}
$ echo 'Hello, World.'
~~~
~~~ {.output}
Hello, World.
~~~

Do we really need to put the word or phrase we want to echo in quotes? Let's try priting hello to the screen with and without quotes.

~~~ {.bash}
$ echo 'hello'
~~~
~~~ {.output}
hello
~~~

~~~ {.bash}
$ echo hello
~~~
~~~ {.output}
hello
~~~

So, that worked fine either way. Let's try echoing hello with exclamation marks! 

~~~ {.bash}
$ echo hello!!
~~~
~~~ {.output}
echo helloecho hello!
helloecho hello!
~~~

~~~ {.bash}
$ echo 'hello!!'
~~~
~~~ {.output}
hello!!
~~~

Wow, what happened there?  This is one example when what you want to say needs to be in a quote. We will see more later.

## Writing files with `echo >` and `echo >>`

In these examples, the standard output went the screen, which is why you can see it. But, we can also redirect the output elsewhere, like to a text file with `>` or `>>`. The `>` will send the output to a file, overriding anything that may have already been there. The  `>>` will append the input to a new line of the file. Let's take a look

~~~ {.bash}
$ echo hello > hello.txt
$ echo hello > hello.txt
$ echo hello >> hellohello.txt
$ echo hello >> hellohello.txt
$ ls
~~~


## Looking at files with cat, head, tail, and less

### cat
We just made two files, but how do we look at them? Let's explore a few of the many ways.

`cat <filename>` file name print the context to the screen. We can even print multiple files to the screen at once like this `cat <filename> <filename>`

~~~ {.bash}
$ cat hello.txt
$ cat hellohello.txt
$ cat hello.txt hellohello.txt
~~~

## Line navigation
You can’t use the mouse to move the cursor in the command line so your options are to use the arrow and some of the commands below when you’re moving through very long lines/paths.
- ctrl-d : delete the character under the cursor
- ctrl-a : move to the beginning of the line
- ctrl-e : move to the end of the line
- up arrow : previous command (you can keep pushing the arrow to scroll through many previous commands)
- down arrow : next command
- ctrl-k : delete from the cursor to the end of the line

## ctrl-c 
This keystroke combination will kill the currently running command. We’ve only being using commands that return small amounts of information. When you’re running more complicated commands sometimes you end up sending things into a infinite loop (oops) or you may realize part of the way through that you’ve typed the wrong thing (oops) and want to stop the command.
